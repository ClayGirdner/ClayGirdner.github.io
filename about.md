Welcome! My name is Clay Girdner and I am an aspiring data scientist with a love for all things sports (especially football). I am based out of Denver, where I live with my beautiful fiance, Samantha.

I created this blog as a way to practice my writing/coding/visualizations while also having somewhere to house and show off my work. All visualizations and data wrangling/analyis is done using python or R.
