Title: Will the Real Baker Mayfield Please Stand Up?
---
Many adjectives can be used to describe Baker Mayfield and his brief NFL career, but few would use the word “boring” when talking about the fiery young quarterback.

The drama started long before Mayfield made his NFL debut, hell, even before he was selected by the Browns in the 2018 draft. Following a stellar college career, analyst opinions regarding the Oklahoma prospect were famously split – ranging from “undraftable” to surefire first overall pick (where he was ultimately taken). Since then, Baker has somehow managed to become even more polarizing. Through two NFL seasons, Baker’s erratic on-field performances and controversial off-field comments/decisions have provided supporters and detractors alike with more than enough ammunition to maintain their entrenched positions regarding Mr. Mayfield.

Whether you like the guy or not, for whatever reason, I think it’s safe to say that Baker’s play on the field has been a rollercoaster to this point. Just take a look at his weekly performance chart through 30 NFL games – with all its swings and undulations, I’d say it more closely resembles a WW1 battlefield than a promising start to an NFL career.
