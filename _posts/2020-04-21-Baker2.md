## An Explanatory Analysis

Welcome to part two of our deep dive into Baker Mayfield’s young (but fascinating) NFL career! In [part one]( https://claygirdner.github.io/Baker1/) we explored the fledgling QB’s statistics through two seasons and ultimately divided Baker’s brief NFL stint into three distinct periods – early struggles under the Hue Jackson regime, an ascendant second half of 2018 with Freddie Kitchens calling the plays, and a sophomore slump that ultimately lead to Freddie’s firing. 

In this installment, we continue down the rabbit hole in an attempt to understand _why_ – why Baker stunk it up with Todd Haley as OC, why his rookie campaign turned around under Kitchens, and why the Browns passing offense stagnated in 2019. Once the why’s are covered, we look to the future by examining the pairing of Baker and his newest play-caller, former Vikings OC Kevin Stefanski. 


### 2018: Weeks 3-8

Mayfield kicked off his NFL career with a bang, leading the Browns to a comeback victory over the Jets in week three after replacing Tyrod Taylor following a concussion. However, if you read part one or remotely follow the NFL you will know that the good times would not last for long. Baker and the Browns offense regressed in the following weeks, losing four of their next five games before Jackson and Haley were ultimately shown the door.

What went wrong with the Browns offense? Why were drives stalling? Why was Baker taking a beating seemingly every time he dropped back to throw? Fortunately, the football-viewing public now has access to granular team and player-level data which helps us begin to answer some of these questions by examining the relationship between play-calling tendencies and offensive production. Because this article is focused on Baker Mayfield, we will limit our investigation to passing metrics with data courtesy of Sports Info Solutions (SIS) and nflscrapR, including the following variables:
- play-action rate
- shotgun rate
- screen rate
- bootleg rate
- dropback depth
- average depth of target (aDOT)
- average number of wide receivers

The following table shows the 2018 Browns passing offense from weeks 3-8 (the weeks Baker played under Jackson and Haley) with accompanying rankings relative to the other 2018 NFL passing offenses.

After exploring the splits for each of these variables, something stuck out about Baker’s performance on plays with deep dropbacks, specifically 5-7 step drops out of shotgun. Through week 8, Mayfield scraped together a passer rating of 79.9 with a 40.8% success rate (plays resulting in positive EPA) on his 240 total dropbacks. However, if we just look at his 22 deep dropbacks from shotgun his passer rating plummets to 30.4 and success rate drops to 22.7%. Although these plays constituted less than 10% of Mayfield’s total dropbacks, these plays had a sizeable impact on Baker’s aggregate stats as they accounted for -10.2 of his -30.3 total expected points added (EPA) through week 8. 

It should also be noted that Brett Kollmann found a similar finding in his film study [_The Ballad of Baker Mayfield_]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx8nXTjEqhI), which was the original inspiration for this write up. Once again, I highly recommend checking out his content.

Combining Kollmann’s analysis with our own review of the all-22, we determined that each failed deep dropback contained one or more of these three elements:
- Subpar pass blocking on the outside
- Baker’s struggles to step up into the pocket while keeping his eyes downfield
- Poor timing between Baker and his receivers

Let’s take a look at some examples! Here is one such play which came on a big third down late in the game against the Ravens in week 5.
